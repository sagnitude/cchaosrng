#Chaos RNG C Implementation

Basic Structure

ChaosPool is a simulation of ideal gas.

  Has Temperature  ->  ChaosPool  <-  Input Entropy
      Has Entropy  ->             <-  Input Energy
         Has Mass  ->             ->  Output Entropy
       Has Volume  ->             ->  Generate Bits with Entropy
